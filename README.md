# DL_Project_HumanAtlasImage

For InceptionResNet, we implemented 2 versions, Inception_resnet_v2_base_model.ipynb and Inception_resnet_v2_base_model2.ipynb, one uses random weights initialization and another use pretrained weights from imagenet. Inception_retrain is used for model retraining and improve accuracy.
